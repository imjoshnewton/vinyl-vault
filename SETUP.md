## Testing the App

1. Start the development server: `bun run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in terminal)
3. Click "Sign Up" to create an account
4. You'll be prompted to setup your profile:
   - Choose a username (e.g., "john-doe")
   - Enable "Make my collection public"
   - Click "Create Collection"
5. You'll be redirected to your public collection at `/u/your-username`
6. Click "Add Record" to add your first vinyl record
7. Use the form to add details like:
   - Artist: "Pink Floyd"
   - Title: "The Dark Side of the Moon" 
   - Type: "LP"
   - Release Year: "1973"
   - Genre: "Progressive Rock"
8. Try the features:
   - Sort the table by clicking column headers
   - Click "Play" to increment play count (only visible to you as owner)
   - Click "Spin" to randomly select a record
   - Click "Share Collection" to get your public link

## Public Sharing

9. Share your collection URL (`/u/your-username`) with friends

    - They can view your records and statistics
    - They can use the Spin feature
    - They **cannot** add, edit, or delete records
    - They **cannot** track plays
11. If they're signed in, they can click "My Collection" to go to their own

The application now includes **complete public sharing functionality** where users can share their vinyl collections with friends while maintaining proper ownership controls!
